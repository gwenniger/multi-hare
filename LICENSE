University of Collins Avenue, Glasnevin, Dublin 9, Ireland (the “Licensor”, “DCU”, “us” or “we”) for Handwriting
Recognition (the “Software”).

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ALL USERS:
BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE
TERMS OF THIS LICENCE, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.

Parties hereto agree as follows:
Grant and scope of licence

1. 	In consideration of your agreeing to abide by the terms of this Licence, the Licensor hereby grants to you a non-
	exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable, revocable licence to use the Software for non-commercial
	purposes on the terms of this Licence.

2. 	If you intend on using the Software for commercial purposes, you must obtain a commercial licence from the DCU
	Invent. For further information please contact info@invent.dcu.ie.

Restrictions

3. 	Except as expressly set out in this Licence, you undertake:
	3.1 	not to use the Software for commercial purposes;

	3.2 	not to translate the Software into any computer language aside from the current source code language;
		and
	3.3 	not to rent, lease, sub-license or loan the Software.

Obligations

4. 	You undertake and warrant:
	4.1 	To reference your use of the Software in any publications or academic research which is based or partly
		based on findings obtained using the Software including where the Software is used to gather data or
		information used in such publications or academic research. Your obligations under this clause will be met
		where you include wording along the following lines in your publication or academic research: “This
		publication has emanated from research supported in part by a research grant from Science Foundation
		Ireland under Grant Number 13/RC/2106”.

Intellectual property rights

5. 	You acknowledge that all intellectual property rights in the Software throughout the world belong to the Licensor,
	that rights in the Software are licensed (not sold) to you, and that you have no rights in, or to, the Software other
	than the right to use them in accordance with the terms of this Licence.

No Warranty

6. 	You acknowledge that any the Software is provided to you on an &quot;as is&quot; basis now and in the future. All conditions,
	warranties or other terms which might have effect between the parties or be implied or incorporated into this
	licence or any collateral contract, whether by statute, common law or otherwise, are hereby excluded to the
	maximum extent permitted by law, including the implied conditions, warranties or other terms as to satisfactory
	quality, fitness for purpose or the use of reasonable skill and care in the preparation of the Software.



7. 	You acknowledge that the Software may not be free of errors or bugs. DCU has no obligation to support or update
	the Software in any way.

Limitation of Liability

8. 	You acknowledge that the Software has not been developed to meet your individual requirements and that it is
	therefore your responsibility to ensure that the facilities and functions of the Software meet your requirements.

9. 	We shall not under any circumstances whatever be liable to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence),
	breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, arising under or in connection with the Licence for loss of profits, sales,
	business, or revenue, business interruption, loss of anticipated savings, loss or corruption of data or information,
	loss of business opportunity, goodwill or reputation or any indirect or consequential loss or damage.

10. 	Other than the losses set out in term 9 (for which we are not liable), our maximum aggregate liability under or in
	connection with this Licence whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, shall in all
	circumstances be limited to a sum equal to the total fees paid by the Licensee to DCU. This maximum cap does not
	apply to term 11.

11. 	Nothing in this Licence shall limit or exclude our liability for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence,
	fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation or any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited by Irish law.

12. 	This Licence sets out the full extent of our obligations and liabilities in respect of the supply of the Software. Except
	as expressly stated in this Licence, there are no conditions, warranties, representations or other terms, express or
	implied, that are binding on us. Any condition, warranty, representation or other term concerning the supply of
	the Software which might otherwise be implied into, or incorporated in, this Licence whether by statute, common
	law or otherwise, is excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Termination

13. 	We may terminate this Licence immediately by written notice to you if you commit a breach of this Licence which
	you fail to remedy (if remediable) within 14 days after the service on you of written notice requiring you to do so.

14. 	Upon termination for any reason:
	14.1 	all rights granted to you under this Licence shall cease;
	14.2 	you must cease all activities authorised by this Licence; and
	14.3 	you must immediately delete or remove the Software from all computer equipment in your possession or
		under your control.

Other Important Terms

15. 	We may transfer our rights and obligations under this Licence to another organisation, but this will not affect your
	rights or our obligations under this Licence.

16. 	You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under this Licence to another person if you obtain our prior
	consent in writing to do so.

17. 	This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between you and us. You acknowledge that you have not relied on
	any statement, promise or representation made or given by or on behalf of us which is not set out in this Licence.

18. 	If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this Licence, or if we do not enforce our rights
	against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not
	mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in
	writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.

19. 	Each of the conditions of this Licence operates separately. If any court or competent authority decides that any of
	them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions will remain in full force and effect.

20. 	This Licence, its subject matter and its formation, are governed by Irish law. You and we both agree to that the
	courts of Ireland will have exclusive jurisdiction.
